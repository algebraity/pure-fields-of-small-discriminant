# Pure Fields of Small Discriminant

This project is a follow up to my [project on quadratic fields](https://github.com/algebraity/quadratic-field-analysis) where I did something similar. My goal is to compute the invariants all all pure, totally real fields with a minimal polynomial of degree p from 3 to some small prime, with discriminant less than some large number that is still computationally feasible.

I learned some interesting things from my previous project, but now that I know more about number fields, I would like to track more invariants for more fields and see what patterns I can find. This would also make a good entry level data engineering project once I have all the numbers, which will enable me to use my fledgling data analysis skills in an interesting way.
